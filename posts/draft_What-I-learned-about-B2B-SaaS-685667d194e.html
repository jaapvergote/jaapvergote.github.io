One founder is focused on sales. You are probably tackling a niche problem in a growing market. Revenue $100–$500k.</p><p name="f81f" id="f81f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Seed stage:</p><p name="d68d" id="d68d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The product ‘grows’ up and starts to address real problems of the initial customers. This is an important moment in the life of a B2B SaaS company. Once you feel you’re getting close to product market fit it’s time to sell and learn from the market at a larger scale. It’s time to hire sales people.</p><p name="afbf" id="afbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I learned that it is smart to hire two sales reps to start with. They will sell together with the sales oriented founder, often the CEO. Two, because it will provide you with a benchmark of what success looks like. If one does really well and the other only sells 60% as much, you know your quota should be closer to the top performer’s numbers.</p><p name="ad7d" id="ad7d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s important that you hire sales people that understand that the product will grow. Feedback from customers is key. The sales people are channeling that feedback and delivering it to the product team. The more customers you get, the more you learn, the better the product gets. Build a flywheel.</p><p name="4443" id="4443" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Growth stage</p><p name="c2a0" id="c2a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">You sold a couple of big logo’s and are able to hit sales targets. It’s time to build out the sales organization. Once you have a couple of AE’s they will benefit from having an SDR.</p></div></div></section>
