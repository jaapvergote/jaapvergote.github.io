I wish there was a two-factor code against my calendar because current me, present me, is always making promises for future me. Current me is tired, exhausted, hungry, wants to go home, wants to go to sleep, wants to read a book, wants to hang out with the wife and baby. Future me is this dynamic, high-energy individual who will always show up to every meeting and will have a lot of energy and will want to get a lot of things done.</p><p name="84cf" id="84cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I commit myself to all these commitments in the future that when the future me arrives, it’s actually this present me that’s back to being lazy and hungry and tired. I want a two-factor against myself. The way I would like to do that is I think every time I make a commitment to anything, I should instead just write it down and then just check back in 48-hours later and then with a clear mind say do I commit to doing this? Even better would be saying, “If I commit to doing something, then I commit to doing it right now.” If I’m not willing to do it right now, then don’t do it. Don’t commit to it.</p></div></div></section>
