Most original thinkers had counterintuitive methods of working/thinking which unearthed new ideas. The key seems to be to get better at idea selection while having a high level of idea generation.</p><h4 name="2fd2" id="2fd2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Made In America — Sam Walton: 4/5</h4><p name="92a0" id="92a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The story of how Sam Walton started Walmart and was able to foster massive growth decade after decade. Highlights the uncommon business practices Walmart  implemented to thrive, the value of frugality in business and running a company focused on small town America. Blown away by Sam’s energy, integrity and achievements. Underrated entrepreneur.</p><h4 name="eaa4" id="eaa4" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">7 Habits of highly effective people- Stephen R. Covey: 4.6/5</h4><p name="1be5" id="1be5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Provides strong mental models on how to be effective. The fundamental idea is to find/know yourself, being comfortable with what you find and then using that as your north star to achieve what you want. Very practical mental models that you can apply immediately in your daily life.</p><h4 name="64a0" id="64a0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The wisdom of crowds — James Surowiecki: 3.8/5</h4><p name="7759" id="7759" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Teaches you the power of groups of people to make decisions. Great insights into how this concept applies to the capital markets. Crowds are wise when they are diverse, strangers to each other and large. </p><h4 name="cfb6" id="cfb6" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Thinking fast and slow — Daniel Kahneman: 4.3/5</h4><p name="96a8" id="96a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Human behavior can be very irrational and very rational. We have a System 1 and a System 2 in our brain. System 1 makes quick decisions, which are mostly irrational and stem from our limbic brain. System 2 is our rational large sapiens brain which needs time to come to a decision. Show you how easily the brain is tricked into using System 1.</p><h4 name="150c" id="150c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Man’s search for meaning — Viktor E. Frankl: 4.6/5</h4><p name="6739" id="6739" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Story of a jewish professor who got sent to the concentration camps and survived. He describes the grim circumstances and day to day of the camps and talks about how different prisoners use different mental strategies to survive. He analyzes the only thing he had left during his incarceration: his conscious mind. Offers a great mental model of how to find meaning as a human in either suffering, work or love for others.</p><h4 name="3f5a" id="3f5a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Here is New York — E.B. White: 4.1/5</h4><p name="939e" id="939e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Thoughts of a writer on a hot summer day in 1920ies New York. Makes some apt metaphors and describes New York from three perspectives: the commuter who work in the city, the OG New Yorker who was born there and the people that moved to NYC because they felt it was their place. The last one is the best New York there is.</p><h4 name="c49b" id="c49b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Rich dad, poor dad — Robert Kiyosaki: 3.6/5</h4><p name="3378" id="3378" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The author describes his experiences growing up with his real dad, who didn’t care about money and a friend’s dad, who taught him how to deal with money as a tool. Touches on basic personal finance (assets, expenses, income,…) and the methods to deploy to build up your own wealth.</p><h4 name="fc84" id="fc84" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The selfish gene — Richard Dawkins: 3.5/5</h4><p name="cad7" id="cad7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A perspective on life where not the individual organism is the unit of evolution, but the gene. Organisms are vessels which the evolution of genes led to, to ensure the continuous existence and spreading of the genes. </p><h4 name="6e66" id="6e66" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The big thirst — Charles Fishman: 3.8/5</h4><p name="3cc9" id="3cc9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Freakonomics for water. Gives you insight into the world’s water consumption and the challenges our species will face in the near future. There is only a limited amount of water on this planet, it just transitions from one vessel or state to another. A big part all the water is tied up in organisms (you, me, animals and plants).</p><h4 name="573f" id="573f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Lean Startup — Eric Ries: 4.5/5</h4><p name="b57c" id="b57c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">How to develop your customer before you develop your expensive product. Listen to the market and build what it wants in your specific niche. Listening to customers is vastly more important than building anything. </p><h4 name="3010" id="3010" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde — Robert Louis Stevenson: 3.9/5</h4><p name="c8b0" id="c8b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A classic about a doctor who experiences a body transformation and tries to deal with the consequences.</p><h4 name="92ad" id="92ad" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Audition — Ryu Murakami: 4/5</h4><p name="4fd3" id="4fd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Japanese novel about a man who meets a very peculiar women. There’s a lot more to her than you’d think.</p><h4 name="bb2f" id="bb2f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Hooked — Nir Eyal: 3.7/5</h4><p name="cd71" id="cd71" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Overview of techniques on how to engage users with your software product. How to engrain the product into their daily life and make using it a habit. Interesting, but quite straightforward in this day and time.</p><h4 name="c59a" id="c59a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Influence — Robert B Cialdini: 4.4/5</h4><p name="de5b" id="de5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">A classic on how to influence people’s decision making. 7 well written chapters that each highlight a tool to influence people’s minds. More a psychology book than a business book. Very very practical and useful in daily life. </p><p name="87c1" id="87c1" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="5f59" id="5f59" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="ecb3" id="ecb3" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="6eca" id="6eca" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="a01e" id="a01e" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
