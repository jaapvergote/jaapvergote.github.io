<div class="post-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="45f9" name="45f9">Jogging became popularized in the 70s and gained a steady following ever since. Taking care of you physical health and body became accepted and respected.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2a9a" name="2a9a">Today we seem to be experiencing something similar with mental health. Many people struggle with simple anxiety, stress and other minor mental issues that impact their day to day. They don‚Äôt always have methods to make these mental conditions go away or to change them. Mental health can be improved just like your physical health. You just have to start jogging (mentally).</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3cba" name="3cba">I like to compare it with being overweight. Some people are morbid obese, but most people just have a few extra pounds they‚Äôd like to loose to feel healthier. They know it will make their lives better and easier. Mental health is exactly the same. There are some people with serious issues that need heavy medication and professional help, but most people just have some minor issues that are keeping them from performing at their top level.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="fe3a" name="fe3a">Like gyms, there might be mental training clubs one day. Like jogging, you can meditate daily. Like dietists, there will be more and more people able to help you with mental health plans and exercises to become mentally fit.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="0f59" name="0f59">Meditation is a first step to a good mental health. It‚Äôs like jogging. Easy, quick and effective. And it makes you stronger if you keep it up. Your mental health is as or more important than your physical health. Work on it.</p></div><footer><p>By <a class="p-author h-card" href="https://medium.com/@JaapVergote">Jaap Vergote</a></p></footer></div>
