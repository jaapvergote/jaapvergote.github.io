<div class="post-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3" id="b90c" name="b90c">I recently stumbled upon this. Pure wisdom. Definitely for those people with a desire to ‘get rich quick’. Read until the end.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4ff4" name="4ff4">In line with my one of my previous posts (<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" data-href="https://medium.com/@JaapVergote/20-money-is-a-magnifier-1e87f4b2a385" href="https://medium.com/@JaapVergote/20-money-is-a-magnifier-1e87f4b2a385" target="_blank">nr. 20</a>), being rich in monetary terms is destructive when you’re not rich in self awareness, good relationships and both mental and physical health.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7d98" name="7d98">Words by <a class="markup--user markup--p-user" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" data-action-value="67f5049293c7" data-anchor-type="2" data-href="https://medium.com/u/67f5049293c7" data-user-id="67f5049293c7" href="https://medium.com/u/67f5049293c7" target="_blank">Naval Ravikant</a>:</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f0d1" name="f0d1">1/ Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1e37" name="1e37">2/ Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="53f2" name="53f2">3/ Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1282" name="1282">4/ You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity — a piece of a business — to gain your financial freedom.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="988a" name="988a">5/ You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8758" name="8758">6/ Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="27a1" name="27a1">7/ The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven’t figured this out yet.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="955b" name="955b">8/ Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="1cb0" name="1cb0">9/ Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9600" name="9600">10/ Don’t partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="19e0" name="19e0">11/ Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="8e89" name="8e89">12/ Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="afaa" name="afaa">13/ Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="2b71" name="2b71">14/ Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="cb49" name="cb49">15/ Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="51d2" name="51d2">16/ When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="efdb" name="efdb">17/ Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4833" name="4833">18/ Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="7441" name="7441">19/ The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b51c" name="b51c">20/ “Give me a lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.” — Archimedes</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="ff68" name="ff68">21/ Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6543" name="6543">22/ Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability, and show resulting good judgment.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e3c7" name="e3c7">23/ Labor means people working for you. It’s the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6d3f" name="6d3f">24/ Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dabd" name="dabd">25/ Code and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="353d" name="353d">26/ An army of robots is freely available — it’s just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4bb6" name="4bb6">27/ If you can’t code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="6a36" name="6a36">28/ Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="478b" name="478b">29/ Judgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="55bf" name="55bf">30/ There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="dbf9" name="dbf9">31/ Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e440" name="e440">32/ Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="3d51" name="3d51">33/ You should be too busy to “do coffee,” while still keeping an uncluttered calendar.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="4ca8" name="4ca8">34/ Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="9eb0" name="9eb0">35/ Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e387" name="e387">36/ Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="db05" name="db05">37/ There are no get rich quick schemes. That’s just someone else getting rich off you.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="b668" name="b668">38/ Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve.</p><p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="3806" name="3806">39/ When you’re finally wealthy, you’ll realize that it wasn’t what you were seeking in the first place. But that’s for another day.</p></div><footer><p>By <a class="p-author h-card" href="https://medium.com/@JaapVergote">Jaap Vergote</a></p></footer></div>
